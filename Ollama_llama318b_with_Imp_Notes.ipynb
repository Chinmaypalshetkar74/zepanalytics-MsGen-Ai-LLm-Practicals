It's a way for the model to understand relationships between different tokens or positions in the input.\n",
      "\n",
      "In simple terms, self-attention works by computing a weighted sum of the values from different positions in the input, where the weights are learned during training. The input is split into three components: queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V). The model then computes attention scores between each query and key, which represents how relevant each pair is to each other.\n",

      "The attention mechanism consists of two main steps:\n",

      "1. **Attention calculation**: The model computes the attention weights (α) by taking the dot product of Q and K, and applying a softmax function to get the normalized weights.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the context of the provided figures (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5), self-attention helps the model understand long-distance dependencies between tokens. For example, in Figure 3, the attention mechanism is able to attend to a distant dependency of the verb \"making\" in layer 5 of 6.\n",

      "1. **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Self-attention is a crucial component of the Transformer model that allows it to attend to different parts of the input sequence and weigh their importance for generating the output.\n",

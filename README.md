# ZepAnalytics Master Generative AI – Practicals Repository

This repository contains all the hands‑on practicals, experiments, and projects I completed while learning from the ZepAnalytics Master Generative AI Udemy course. The work documented here represents a mix of guided exercises from the instructor and independent implementations created by me.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository showcases:

My practical implementations from the course.

Additional experiments I performed for deeper understanding.

Updated versions of code using the latest LangChain and Ollama integrations.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows built largely by myself, due to major LangChain updates not covered in the original course.

Even though the course was created before the recent LangChain updates, it provided a strong foundation. I explored the latest LangChain documentation, adapted the examples, and modernized the implementations.

🚀 Key Highlights
✔️ Instructor-Guided Practicals

Completed all core practicals taught in the Udemy course.

Followed the instructor's workflow, adapting logic wherever required.

## ✔️ Self-Built Enhancements

Ollama-based LLM pipelines using updated libraries.

Modern LangChain RAG architecture (Breaking changes handled).

Improved chunking, vector DB workflows, and custom prompts.

Multiple notebooks updated with latest LangChain modules.

### ✔️ Additional Explorations
Experimented with new embedding models.
Tried alternative vector stores.
Explored updated loaders, retrievers, and RAG patterns.
Tested performance across various Ollama models (Llama 3, TinyLlama, Gemma, etc.).

## 🧠 Technologies Used

Python
LangChain (Latest Updates)
Ollama (Local LLMs)
Chroma / FAISS Vector DBs
PDF/Text Loaders

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- To demonstrate my hands‑on skills in Generative AI, RAG, LangChain, and Ollama.
- To document my journey as I upgraded older course content to match 2025+ standards.
- To showcase practical knowledge for employers, collaborators, and interviewers.
